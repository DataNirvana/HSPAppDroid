<h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>

<h2>Livestock, livelihoods, and emergencies</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class='paraDefault'>This chapter presents general guidance on questions such as:</p>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>Why are livestock projects important to humanitarian response?</li>

<li class='listBullet'>How do different types of emergency affect people who keeplivestock?</li>

<li class='listBullet'>How does LEGS link with a rights-based approach?</li>

<li class='listBullet'>What are the livelihoods objectives of LEGS?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Livelihoods and emergencies</h3>

<p class='paraDefault'>Increasingly, it is recognized that humanitarian action must consider the livelihoods of affected populations – it is not just about saving human lives but protecting and strengthening livelihoods. This shift in focus helps the rapid recovery of those affected by an emergency and can also increase their long- term resilience and reduce their vulnerability to future shocks and disasters.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Taking a livelihoods approach also helps to harmonize relief and development initiatives, which historically have often been separate and at times contradictory (see Box I.1 in the Introduction to LEGS). It is now acknowledged that some emergency responses may have saved lives in the short term but have failed to protect – and at times have even destroyed – local livelihood strategies. They have also undermined existing development initiatives and have negatively impacted on local service provision. While it may be true that development can sometimes have negative impacts and that maintaining a level of independence between emergency and development responses may be beneficial, it is nonetheless important that those responsible for relief efforts understand and take into account local development activities, particularly those that aim to strengthen local livelihoods. This is the premise on which LEGS is based.</p>

<h6>Livestock and livelihoods</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>Animals play a significant role in the livelihoods of many people throughout the world. Livestock keepers range from pastoralists, whose livelihoods are largely dependent on livestock, and agro-pastoralists, who depend on a combination of herds and crops, to smallholder farmers, who depend largely on crops but whose cows, goats, pigs, or poultry provide an important supplementary source of protein or income. There are also a diverse range of service providers, suchas mule or donkey cart owners, who depend on livestock for their income; then there are traders, shopkeepers, and other merchants whose businesses depend significantly on livestock. Animals also constitute a supplementary source of income or food for urban and peri-urban populations.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>LEGS uses the term ‘livestock’ to refer to all species of animals that support livelihoods. LEGS also provides guidance on livestock kept by displaced people, including those living in camps.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (DFID, 1999) is a useful tool for understanding and analysing livelihoods in both emergency and development situations. Although different variations of the framework exist, all start with understanding the different ‘assets’ (see Glossary) that households use as the basis for their livelihood strategies. For humanitarian programming, assets are important because people with greater financial and social assets tend to be more resilient to crises. The ability of livestock keepers to use their assets to support their livelihoods is also affected by their vulnerability, by trends, and by external policies and institutions, all of which must be taken into account in any livelihoods analysis.</p>

<h6>Livestock as financial and social assets</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>For many livestock keepers, animals are a critical financial asset, providing both food (milk, meat, blood, eggs) and income (through sale, barter, transport, draught power, and work hire). Livestock are also significant social assets for many livestock keepers, playing a key role in building and consolidating social relationships and networks within traditional social groups (clan members, in- laws, or friends, for instance), and they are commonly the currency of both gifts and fines.</p>

<h6>Vulnerability</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>Vulnerability relates to people’s ability to withstand shocks and trends. The Sphere Handbook defines vulnerable people as those ‘who are especially susceptible to the effects of natural or manmade disasters or of conflict … due to a combination of physical, social, environmental and political factors’ (Sphere, 2011: 54). For households and individuals that depend on livestock for their livelihoods, vulnerability is directly linked to livestock assets. The greater the value of livestock assets, the greater the resilience of households to cope with shocks.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Understanding the role of livestock in livelihoods and the impact of the emergency, as outlined in Chapter 3, Initial assessment and identifying responses, is essential for determining how appropriate a livestock-based response is. Non- livestock interventions such as food aid, cash grants, or cash/food-for-work can also complement livestock-based responses because they can remove some of the pressure on livestock assets in the short term, thus making recovery more feasible.</p>

<h6>Trends</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>Trends are the long-term changes over time, such as demographic trends, climate change, and economic trends, that impact on livelihood strategies. Although often not considered when designing humanitarian response, attention to trends can be an important aspect of identifying appropriate livestock support. For example, for some people a livestock-based livelihood is so compromised before a crisis that rebuilding their livestock assets post-crisis is of questionable value, and other support, such as cash transfers, may be more useful.</p>

<h6>Policies and institutions</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>In any emergency, both formal and informal policies and institutions influence the ability of people to use their livestock assets to support livelihoods. For example, veterinary service institutions and policies on taxation, marketing, and exports all have an impact on livestock-based livelihoods.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>In general, livelihoods analysis can show how the protection and strengthening of livestock assets can be an important type of livelihood support during emergencies. This approach fits well with the Sphere Handbook, which emphasizes the importance of ‘the protection and promotion of livelihood strategies’, particularly ‘preserving productive assets’ (Sphere, 2011: 151 and 153).</p>

<h3>Types of emergency and their impact on livestock keepers</h3>

<p class='paraDefault'>As summarized in Table 1.1, humanitarian emergencies are categorized as slow onset, rapid onset, and complex. Examples are provided in Box 1.1 following the table. Some emergencies may also be chronic, in that the stages of the crisis continue to repeat themselves – for example, a drought may move from Alert, to Alarm, to Emergency, and back to Alert, without returning to Normal.</p>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Impacts of a slow-onset emergency</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>During the 1999–2001 drought in Kenya, it is estimated that over 2 million sheep and goats, 900,000 cattle, and 14,000 camels died. This represents losses of 30 per cent of small stock and cattle and 18 per cent of camel holdings among the affected pastoralists. Social impact was significant. Families separated, damaging the social networks that provide a safety net for pastoralists, and many people moved to settlements and food distribution centres. Without sufficient livestock to provide for their food needs, many pastoralists became dependent on food aid. Once the drought ended, the losses suffered by some pastoralists had effectively destroyed their livelihoods.</div>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Impacts of a rapid-onsetemergency</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>The Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 had a significant impact on the livestock of the affected people. This included the loss of domestic farm   animals(poultry, sheep, goats, cattle, and water buffalo). In Indonesia, for example, over 78,000 cattle and 61,000 buffalo were killed, together with 52,000 goats, 16,000 sheep, and nearly 1.5 million chickens. Livelihoods were also affected by the destruction of livestock-related infrastructure, such as barns, stores, and processing facilities. Moreover, crop residues, straw, and inland pasture were destroyed.</div>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Impacts of a rapid-onset emergency following adrought</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>The 2001 earthquake in India’s Gujarat State killed or injured nearly 9,000 cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats. The earthquake occurred at 8 a.m., after most livestock had been taken out of the villages to graze; otherwise the losses caused by collapsing buildings would have been much greater. However, because initial relief efforts focused on the human population, livestock were generally left to wander in search of feed and water. Some died from their injuries and others from exposure. The impact of the earthquake on these livestock was magnified by a two-year drought. The lack of forage and pastures prior to the earthquake meant that many livestock were already in poor body condition. The earthquake also caused the collapse of many water tanks and veterinary buildings, which also negatively affected the provision of livestock services.</div>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Impacts of a complexemergency</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>The Darfur region of Sudan, where pastoralists and agro-pastoralists derive up to 50 per cent of their food and income from livestock, has suffered from chronic conflict and recurrent drought for several years. The combined effect of conflict and drought has caused significant livestock losses. Some villagers reported losses of 70–100 per cent due to looting. Overcrowding of livestock and the disruption of veterinary services (both the result of insecurity) added to livestock mortality rates. The closure of the Sudan–Libya border also severely affected livestock trade, significantly impacting on livelihoods. The natural resource base was depleted by the drought, and conflict restricted access to traditional migration routes and grazing lands. The surviving livestock were sold only as a last resort because prices were very low.</div>
