<h1>Minimum Standards in Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion</h1>

<h2>How to use this chapter </h2>

<p class='paraBig'>This chapter is divided into seven main sections: </p>

<ul class='listSummaryGroup'>
<li class='listSummary'>Water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH)</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Hygiene promotion</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Water supply</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Excreta disposal</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Vector control</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Solid waste management</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Drainage</li>
</ul>
<p class='paraDefault'>The Protection Principles and Core Standards must be used consistently with this chapter. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Although primarily intended to inform humanitarian response to a disaster, the minimum standards may also be considered during disaster preparedness and the transition to recovery activities.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Each section contains the following: </p>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>Minimum standards: These are qualitative in nature and specify the minimum levels to be attained in humanitarian response regarding the provision of water, sanitation and hygiene promotion.</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Key actions: These are suggested activities and inputs to help meet the standards.</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Key indicators: These are ‘signals’ that show whether a standard has been attained. They provide a way of measuring and communicating the processes and results of key actions; they relate to the minimum standard, not to the key action.</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Guidance notes: These include specific points to consider when applying the minimum standards, key actions and key indicators in different situations. They provide guidance on tackling practical difficulties, benchmarks or advice on priority issues. They may also include critical issues relating to the standards, actions or indicators, and describe dilemmas, controversies or gaps in current knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p class='paraDefault'>If the required key indicators and actions cannot be met, the resulting adverse implications for the affected population should be appraised and appropriate mitigating actions taken. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>A needs assessment checklist is included as Appendix 1; guideline notes are provided in Appendices 2–6; and a select list of references and further reading, which points to sources of information on both specific and general issues relating to this chapter, is also provided.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h6>Links to the Humanitarian Charter and international law</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>The minimum standards for water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH) are a practical expression of the shared beliefs and commitments of humanitarian agencies and the common principles, rights and duties governing humanitarian action that are set out in the Humanitarian Charter. Founded on the principle of humanity, and reflected in international law, these principles include the right to life and dignity, the right to protection and security and the right to receive humanitarian assistance on the basis of need. A list of key legal and policy documents that inform the Humanitarian Charter is available for reference in Annex 1 (see page 356), with explanatory comments for humanitarian workers.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Although states are the main duty-bearers with respect to the rights set out above, humanitarian agencies have a responsibility to work with disaster-affected populations in a way that is consistent with these rights. From these general rights flow a number of more specific entitlements. These include the rights to participation, information and non-discrimination that form the basis of the Core Standards, as well the specific rights to water, sanitation, food, shelter and health that underpin these and the minimum standards in this Handbook.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Everyone has the right to water and sanitation. This right is recognised in international legal instruments and provides for sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses and accessible sanitation facilities. An adequate amount of safe water is necessary to prevent death from dehydration, to reduce the risk of water-related disease and to provide for consumption, cooking and personal and domestic hygienic requirements. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The right to water and sanitation is inextricably related to other human rights, including the right to health, the right to housing and the right to adequate food. As such, it is part of the guarantees essential for human survival. States and non-state actors have responsibilities in fulfilling the right to water and sanitation. In times of armed conflict, for example, it is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless drinking water installations or irrigation works.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The minimum standards in this chapter are not a full expression of the right to water and sanitation. However, the Sphere standards reflect the core content of the right to water and sanitation and contribute to the progressive realisation of this right globally.</p>

<h6>The importance of WASH in disasters</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>Water and sanitation are critical determinants for survival in the initial stages of a disaster. People affected by disasters are generally much more susceptible to illness and death from disease, which to a large extent are related to inadequate sanitation, inadequate water supplies and inability to maintain good hygiene. The most significant of these diseases are diarrhoeal and infectious diseases transmitted by the faeco-oral route (see Appendix 4: Water- and excreta-related diseases and transmission mechanisms). Other water- and sanitation-related diseases include those carried by vectors associated with solid waste and water. The term ‘sanitation’, throughout the Sphere Handbook, refers to excreta disposal, vector control, solid waste disposal and drainage.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The main objective of WASH programmes in disasters is to reduce the transmission of faeco-oral diseases and exposure to disease-bearing vectors through the promotion of:</p>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>good hygiene practices </li>

<li class='listBullet'>the provision of safe drinking water </li>

<li class='listBullet'>the reduction of environmental health risks </li>

<li class='listBullet'>the conditions that allow people to live with good health, dignity, comfort and security. </li>
</ul>
<p class='paraDefault'>Simply providing sufficient water and sanitation facilities will not, on its own, ensure their optimal use or impact on public health. In order to achieve the maximum benefit from a response, it is imperative that disaster-affected people have the necessary information, knowledge and understanding to prevent water- and sanitation-related diseases and to mobilise their involvement in the design and maintenance of those facilities. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The use of communal water and sanitation facilities, for example in refugee or displaced situations, can increase women’s and girls’ vulnerability to sexual and other forms of gender-based violence. In order to minimise these risks, and to provide a better quality of response, it is important to ensure women’s participation in water supply and sanitation programmes. An equitable participation of women and men in planning, decision-making and local management will help to ensure that the entire affected population has safe and easy access to water supply and sanitation services, and that services are appropriate.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Better disaster response in public health is achieved through better preparedness. Such preparedness is the result of capacities, relationships and knowledge developed by governments, humanitarian agencies, local civil society organisations, communities and individuals to anticipate and respond effectively to the impact of likely, imminent hazards. It is based on an analysis of risks and is well linked to early warning systems. Preparedness includes contingency planning, stockpiling of equipment and supplies, emergency services and stand-by arrangements, personnel training and community-level planning training and drills.</p>

<h6>Links to other chapters</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>Many of the standards in the other chapters are relevant to this chapter. Progress in achieving standards in one area often influences and even determines progress in other areas. For a response to be effective, close coordination and collaboration are required with other sectors. Coordination with local authorities and other responding agencies is also necessary to ensure that needs are met, that efforts are not duplicated and that the quality of water and sanitation interventions is optimised.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>For example, where nutritional standards have not been met, the urgency to improve the standard of water and sanitation is greater as people’s vulnerability to disease will have significantly increased. The same applies to populations where HIV and AIDS prevalence is high or where there is a large proportion of older people or persons with disabilities. Priorities should be decided on the basis of sound information shared between sectors as the situation evolves. Reference is also made, where relevant, to companion and complementary standards. </p>

<h6>Links to the Protection Principles and Core Standards </h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>In order to meet the standards of this Handbook, all humanitarian agencies should be guided by the Protection Principles, even if they do not have a distinct protection mandate or specialist capacity in protection. The Principles are not ‘absolute’: it is recognised that circumstances may limit the extent to which agencies are able to fulfil them. Nevertheless, the Principles reflect universal humanitarian concerns which should guide action at all times. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The Core Standards are essential process and personnel standards shared by all sectors. The six core standards cover people-centred humanitarian response; coordination and collaboration; assessment; design and response; performance, transparency and learning; and aid worker performance. They provide a single reference point for approaches that underpin all other standards in the Handbook. Each technical chapter, therefore, requires the companion use of the Core Standards to help attain its own standards. In particular, to ensure the appropriateness and quality of any response, the participation of disaster-affected people – including the groups and individuals most frequently at risk in disasters – should be maximised.</p>

<h6>Vulnerabilities and capacities of disaster-affected populations</h6>

<p class='paraDefault'>This section is designed to be read in conjunction with, and to reinforce, the Core Standards. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>It is important to understand that to be young or old, a woman or an individual with a disability or HIV does not, of itself, make a person vulnerable or at increased risk. Rather, it is the interplay of factors that does so: for example, someone who is over 70 years of age, lives alone and has poor health is likely to be more vulnerable than someone of a similar age and health status living within an extended family and with sufficient income. Similarly, a 3-year-old girl is much more vulnerable if she is unaccompanied than if she were living in the care of responsible parents.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>As WASH standards and key actions are implemented, a vulnerability and capacity analysis helps to ensure that a disaster response effort supports those who have a right to assistance in a non-discriminatory manner and who need it most. This requires a thorough understanding of the local context and of how a particular crisis impacts on particular groups of people in different ways due to their pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g. being very poor or discriminated against), their exposure to various protection threats (e.g. gender-based violence including sexual exploitation), disease incidence or prevalence (e.g. HIV or tuberculosis) and possibilities of epidemics (e.g. measles or cholera). Disasters can make pre-existing inequalities worse. However, support for people’s coping strategies, resilience and recovery capacities is essential. Their knowledge, skills and strategies need to be supported and their access to social, legal, financial and psychosocial support advocated for. The various physical, cultural, economic and social barriers they may face in accessing these services in an equitable manner also need to be addressed. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>The following highlight some of the key areas that will ensure that the rights and capacities of all vulnerable people are considered: </p>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>Optimise people’s participation, ensuring that all representative groups are included, especially those who are less visible (e.g. individuals who have communication or mobility difficulties, those living in institutions, stigmatised youth and other under- or unrepresented groups).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Disaggregate data by sex and age (0–80+ years) during assessment – this is an important element in ensuring that the WASH sector adequately considers the diversity of populations.</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Ensure that the right to information on entitlements is communicated in a way that is inclusive and accessible to all members of the community. </li>
</li></ul>
<h4>The minimum standards</h4>

<h5>1.Water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (wash)</h5>

<p class='paraDefault'>The aim of any WASH programme is to promote good personal and environmental hygiene in order to protect health, as shown in the diagram below. An effective WASH programme relies on an exchange of information between the agency and the disaster-affected population in order to identify key hygiene problems and culturally appropriate solutions. Ensuring the optimal use of all water supply and sanitation facilities and practising safe hygiene will result in the greatest impact on public health.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Hygiene promotion is vital to a successful WASH intervention. The focus on hygiene promotion is general and specific. In general terms, hygiene promotion is integral to all of the sections and is reflected in the indicators for water supply, excreta disposal, vector control, solid waste management and drainage. More specifically, the focus narrows on two hygiene promotion standards in this chapter and relates to particular hygiene promotion activities.</p>

</ul>
<span class='keyPoint'>Key indicators</span>

<span class='keyPointQualifier'>(to be read in conjunction with the guidance note)</span>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>All groups within the population have safe and equitable access to WASH resources and facilities, use the facilities provided and take action to reduce the public health risk (see Hygiene promotion standard 2 on page 94).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>All WASH staff communicate clearly and respectfully with those affected and share project information openly with them, including knowing how to answer questions from community members about the project. </li>

<li class='listBullet'>There is a system in place for the management and maintenance of facilities as appropriate, and different groups contribute equitably (see guidance note 1).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>All users are satisfied that the design and implementation of the WASH programme have led to increased security and restoration of dignity.</li>
</ul>
<span class='keyPoint'>Guidance note</span>

<ol class='listNumGroup'>
<li class='listNum'>Assessing needs: an assessment is needed to identify risky practices that might increase vulnerability and to predict the likely success of both the provision of WASH facilities and hygiene promotion activities. The key risks are likely to centre on physical safety in accessing facilities, discrimination of marginalised groups that affects access, use and maintenance of toilets, the lack of hand-washing with soap or an alternative, the unhygienic collection and storage of water, and unhygienic food storage and preparation. The assessment should look at resources available to the population, as well as local knowledge and practices, so that promotional activities are effective, relevant and practical. Social and cultural norms that might facilitate and/or compromise adherence to safe hygiene practices should be identified as part of the initial and ongoing assessment. The assessment should pay special attention to the needs of vulnerable people. If consultation with any group of vulnerable people is not possible, this should be clearly stated in the assessment report and addressed as quickly as possible (see Core Standard 3 on page 61).</li>
</li></ol>
<h5>2.Hygiene promotion</h5>

<p class='paraDefault'>Hygiene promotion is a planned, systematic approach to enable people to take action to prevent and/or mitigate water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases. It can also provide a practical way to facilitate community participation, accountability and monitoring in WASH programmes. Hygiene promotion should aim to draw on the affected population’s knowledge, practices and resources, as well as on the current WASH evidence base to determine how public health can best be protected. </p>

<p class='paraDefault'>Hygiene promotion involves ensuring that people make the best use of the water, sanitation and hygiene-enabling facilities and services provided and includes the effective operation and maintenance of the facilities. The three key factors are: </p>

<ol class='listNumGroup'>
<li class='listNum'>a mutual sharing of information and knowledge </li>

<li class='listNum'>the mobilisation of affected communities</li>

<li class='listNum'>the provision of essential materials and facilities. </li>
</ol>
<p class='paraDefault'>Community mobilisation is especially appropriate during disasters as the emphasis must be on encouraging people to take action to protect their health. Promotional activities should include, where possible, interactive methods, rather than focusing exclusively on the mass dissemination of messages. </p>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Hygiene promotion standard 1: Hygiene promotion implementation</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>Affected men, women and children of all ages are aware of key public health risks and are mobilised to adopt measures to prevent the deterioration in hygienic conditions and to use and maintain the facilities provided.</div>

<p class='paraDefault'>
<span class='keyPoint'>Key actions</pspan>

<span class='keyPointQualifier'>(to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes)</span>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>Systematically provide information on hygiene-related risks and preventive actions using appropriate channels of mass communication (see guidance notes 1–2).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Identify specific social, cultural or religious factors that will motivate different social groups in the community and use them as the basis for a hygiene promotion communication strategy (see guidance note 2).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Use interactive hygiene communication methods wherever feasible in order to ensure ongoing dialogue and discussions with those affected (see guidance note 3).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>In partnership with the affected community, regularly monitor key hygiene practices and the use of facilities provided (see guidance note 3 and Core Standard 5, guidance notes 1, 3–5 on pages 69–70).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Negotiate with the population and key stakeholders to define the terms and conditions for community mobilisers (see guidance note 5). </li>
</ul>
<p class='paraDefault'>
<span class='keyPoint'>Key indicators</pspan>

<span class='keyPointQualifier'>(to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes)</span>

<ul class='listBulletGroup'>
<li class='listBullet'>All user groups can describe and demonstrate what they have done to prevent the deterioration of hygiene conditions (see guidance note 1).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>All facilities provided are appropriately used and regularly maintained. </li>

<li class='listBullet'>All people wash their hands after defecation, after cleaning a child’s bottom, before eating and preparing food (see guidance note 6).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>All hygiene promotion activities and messages address key behaviours and misconceptions and are targeted at all user groups (see guidance note 6).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Representatives from all user groups are involved in planning, training, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the hygiene promotion work (see guidance notes 1–6 and Core Standard 1, guidance notes 1–5, on page 56–57).</li>

<li class='listBullet'>Care-takers of young children and infants are provided with the means for safe disposal of children’s faeces (see Excreta disposal standard 1 on page 105 and guidance note 6). </li>
</ul>
<span class='keyPoint'>Guidance notes</span>

<ol class='listNumGroup'>
<li class='listNum'>Targeting priority hygiene risks and behaviours: The understanding gained through assessing hygiene risks, tasks and responsibilities of different groups should be used to plan and prioritise assistance, so that the information flow between humanitarian actors and the affected population is appropriately targeted and misconceptions, where found, are addressed. </li>

<li class='listNum'>Reaching all sections of the population: In the early stages of a disaster, it may be necessary to rely on the mass media to ensure that as many people as possible receive important information about reducing health risks. Different groups should be targeted with different information, education and communication materials through relevant communication channels, so that information reaches all members of the population. This is especially important for those who are non-literate, have communication difficulties and/or do not have access to radio or television. Popular media (drama, songs, street theatre, dance, etc.) might also be effective in this instance. Coordination with the education cluster will be important to determine the opportunities for carrying out hygiene activities in schools. </li>

<li class='listNum'>Interactive methods: Participatory materials and methods that are culturally appropriate offer useful opportunities for affected people to plan and monitor their own hygiene improvements. It also gives them the opportunity to make suggestions or complaints about the programme, where necessary. The planning of hygiene promotion must be culturally appropriate. Hygiene promotion activities need to be carried out by facilitators who have the characteristics and skills to work with groups that might share beliefs and practices different from their own (for example, in some cultures it is not acceptable for women to speak to unknown men). </li>

<li class='listNum'>Overburdening: It is important to ensure that no one group (e.g. women) within the affected population is overburdened with the responsibility for hygiene promotion activities or the management of activities that promote hygiene. Benefits, such as training and employment opportunities, should be offered to women, men and marginalised groups.</li>

<li class='listNum'>Terms and conditions for community mobilisers: The use of outreach workers or home visitors provides a potentially more interactive way to access large numbers of people, but these workers will need support to develop facilitation skills. As a rough guide in a camp scenario, there should be two hygiene promoters/community mobilisers per 1,000 members of the affected population. Community mobilisers may also be employed as daily workers, on a contract or on a voluntary basis, and in accordance with national legislation. Whether workers have paid or volunteer status must be discussed with the affected population, implementing organisations and across clusters to avoid creating tension and disrupting the long-term sustainability of systems already in place. </li>

<li class='listNum'>Motivating different groups to take action: It is important to realise that health may not be the most important motivator for changes in behaviour. The need for privacy, safety, convenience, observation of religious and cultural norms, social status and esteem may be stronger driving forces than the promise of better health. These triggering factors need to be taken into account when designing promotional activities and must be effectively incorporated into the design and siting of facilities in conjunction with the engineering team. The emphasis should not be solely on individual behavioural change but also on social mobilisation and working with groups. </li>

<li class='listNum'>Timeliness of hygiene items distribution: In order to ensure a timely distribution of hygiene items, it may be necessary to distribute some key generic items (soap, jerrycans, etc.) without the agreement of the affected population and come to an agreement concerning future distributions following consultation. </li>

<li class='listNum'>Priority needs: People may choose to sell the items provided if their priority needs are not appropriately met and so people’s livelihoods need to be considered when planning distributions.</li>

<li class='listNum'>Appropriateness: Care should be taken to avoid specifying products that would not be used due to lack of familiarity or that could be misused (e.g. items that might be mistaken for food).
