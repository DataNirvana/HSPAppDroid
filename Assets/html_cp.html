<h1>STANDARDS TO ENSURE A QUALITY CHILD PROTECTION RESPONSE</h1>

<h4>Standards to ensure a quality child protection response </h4>

<h5>These standards focus on key programmingcomponents, including: </h5>

<ul class='listSummaryGroup'>
<li class='listSummary'>Coordination</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Human resources</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Communication, advocacy and media</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Programme cycle management</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Information management</li>

<li class='listSummary'>Child protection monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h5>They do not aim to replace the existing policies and tools on these issues, but rather to provide a child protection-oriented view of each area of work. </h5>

<h5>The standards that follow in the next section are related to specific areas of child protection, but each is linked to the standards described in this first section. </h5>

<h2>STANDARD 1</h2>

<h2>COORDINATION</h2>

<p class='paraDefault'>Coordination helps to make sure that child protection responses are prioritized, efficient, predictable and effective. It avoids partial responses or duplication, and ensures that a provider of last resort is identified when partners are not able to respond to identified needs. It also allows everyone involved in child protection to agree on a shared set of objectives and division of labour. In doing so, it can help create an inter-agency or multi-sectoral response that strengthens the national or community-based child protection system in the long run. Poor coordination can reduce the effect of programming and may even result in harmful programming – for example, programming that weakens family or community protection structures, or which responds only to certain risks to which a child may be exposed, while continuing to leave them exposed to other risks.</p>

<p class='paraDefault'>A number of the key actions in this standard specifically relate to lead agencies – the organisations or government departments that have been agreed or designated as responsible for meeting the coordination function. Other key actions relate to the members of the coordination mechanism (and this is likely to include lead agencies). This does not mean they have to be formal members for these actions to be relevant: their scope includes all those organisations that are active in the context and which therefore have a duty to ensure their actions are coordinated with those of other actors, and for which the coordination mechanism provides this opportunity.</p>

<div class='keyObjHeader'>Standard</div>

<div class='keyObjContent'>Relevant and responsible authorities, humanitarian agencies, civil society organisations and representatives of affected populations coordinate their child protection efforts in order to ensure full, efficient and timely response.</div>
